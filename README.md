Number Guessing Game in Python :- 

->A simple console-based Python game where the computer randomly selects a number and the user tries to guess it within a limited number of attempts. This project is ideal for beginners to understand core Python concepts through hands-on practice.

#Features:-

->Random number generation using Python

->User input handling

->Limited number of guessing attempts

->Helpful hints (Too High / Too Low)

->Clear win and game-over conditions

#Technologies Used:-

->Language: Python

->Library: random

->Platform: Command Line / Jupyter Notebook

#How the Game Works (Step-by-Step):-

1.The program starts by importing the random module.

2.A random number between 1 and 9 is generated.

3.The user is given a fixed number of attempts (e.g., 5).

4.The user enters a guess.

5.The program compares the guess with the generated number:

6.Displays "Too Low" if the guess is smaller

7.Displays "Too High" if the guess is larger

8.Displays success message if the guess is correct

#The game continues until:

->The correct number is guessed, or

->All attempts are exhausted

->If the user fails, the correct number is revealed.
